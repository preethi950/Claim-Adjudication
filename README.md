# Claim-Adjudication
Built a machine learning model to automate healthcare claim adjudication by predicting whether claims should be approved or denied. Preprocessed a large insurance dataset, handled missing values, engineered key features, and trained classification models to optimize decision-making in healthcare insurance workflows.

The project aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of claims processing, reduce manual workload, and enhance fraud detection using predictive analytics.
